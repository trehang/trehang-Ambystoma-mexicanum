## Genome coverage: 
 30.0x 
## Total Assembly nucleotides: 
28,206,905,576

## Fun Facts: 
Ambystoma mexicanum is a useful model organism due to its regenerative abilities. This organism is able to regenerate lost or damaged limbs, spinal cords, and even some parts of the brain. 

Ambystoma mexicanum have 32 billion DNA bases and a genome 10 times the size of a humanâ€™s, therefore, sequencing the DNA of an axolotl is important because it can help scientists learn about the types of genes used in regeneration. This information can later be used in future research surrounding evolution and regeneration of other species.
